# survey-back-api

This API is the backbone of the Survey tool. It collects user feedbacks from the front modal and stores them in a SQLite database.
You can configure the rules for displaying the modal to your users from the YAML config file.
The API also provides an endpoint to fetch the feedbacks from a third party app, such as our BugPrediction.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.8  
OR  
- Docker

## Endpoints

### POST /comments
Creates a new comment and stores it in the database.
It is intended to be used only by the Survey front library.

Request Body  
A JSON object containing the comment details, including the feature URL, comment text, star rating, and the user fingerprint generated by the [front library](https://github.com/optittm/survey-front-library)

Cookies
- user_id: The ID of the user who posted the comment.
- timestamp: The timestamp of when the modal was shown (in this case, it's used as the comment's time).
    
Response
- status code: 201 - Created
- response model: Comment - The newly created comment object.

**WARNING**  
You can choose whether to use the Fingerprint or the cookie user ID by changing the value of `USE_FINGERPRINT` in the `.env` file. You should consider disabling the fingerprint if your data storage and treatment doesn't comply with GPDR.  
You can find more information about how the fingerprint is generated at https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs

- user_id: The ID of the user to filter by.  
- timestamp_start: The minimum timestamp of the comments to filter by (in ISO 8601 format).  
- timestamp_end: The maximum timestamp of the comments to filter by (in ISO 8601 format).

Example response: true
## Usage
### Local installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Create a file in the project directory called ```.env```, and copy the ```.env.example``` file to it.
4. Update the values in .env as needed. You should at least add the URL of your frontend app in ```CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS```.
5. If you want a third-party app to fetch feedback, add its URL to the ```CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS``` field, separated by commas.
6. Fill in the rules.yaml file with the rules for displaying the feedback modal for your projects.
7. Run the API by running ```python main.py```.

### Docker

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a file in the project directory called ```.env```, and copy the ```.env.example``` file to it.
3. Update the values in ```.env``` as needed. You should at least add the URL of your frontend app in ```CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS```.
4. If you want a third-party app to fetch feedback, add its URL to the ```CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS``` field, separated by commas.
5. Fill in the rules.yaml file with the rules for displaying the feedback modal for your projects.
6. Build the Docker image by running ```docker build -t survey-back-api .``` in the project folder.
7. Create and run a container from the image by running ```docker run -dp 8000:8000 survey-back-api```.

## Tests 

To run the unit tests: 

1. Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
2. Run the tests by running ```python -m unittest discover tests```.

You can also run the tests within a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image as described in the Docker section above.
2. Run the tests by running ```docker run --rm [image-name] python -m unittest discover tests```.
